# Mitigated problems with React JS
- DOM manipulation directly with browser document is expensive and slow - `react intorduced the virtual DOM with React reconciliation`
- well known web technology i.e. HTML won't offer reusability of it's container/elements - `react introduced reusable componenets, can be export and import for later uses with ES6 modularity feature of Java Script`
- redirecting experinece in web page - `react itroduced a SPA with router package where it offers the rendering, loading and manipulating all components within same html page ` <br>
React is a popular JavaScript frontend library open-sourced by Facebook. React was born out of the need to solve the problem of the browser DOM being slow.
React is component-based meaning that components are the building blocks of a React UI. 
Another important thing about React is that it’s a Single Page Application (SPA). This means React doesn’t fetch a completely new web page when the user has to be shown a different view, it just re-writes the current web page with any new data fetched from the backend server.
